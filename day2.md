## Test Techniques
### Black Box
- Testing wihtout knowing the inner structure of the system
- Behavioral based
- input output

**5 types of blackbox testing**
1) Equivalence Partitioning (valid vs invalid data/type)
2) Boundary Value Analysis (upper/lower boundaries)
3) Decision Table (Conditions/Actions, Input/Output, "expected result")
4) State Transitioning (state change in one page affect other page)
5) Use Case Test Cases (end-to-end tseting)

### White Box
- Testing with full knowledge of how the system operates
- Structural-based

When to use (levels):
- unit
- integration
- system

**2 types of whitebox testing**
1) statement 
        - every statement will be executed once
        - control-flow path
2) decision
        - every branch will be executed once
        - every statement is taken true/false

### Experience-based
experience of developers and testers
